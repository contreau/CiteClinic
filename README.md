# CiteClinic ![overlaid link icons](./static/favicon-32x32.png)

_CiteClinic_ allows you to easily **retrieve citation information** from any journal article with a valid Digital Object Identifier (DOI) and **generate modifiable, optionally styled UI citation components** for use on your site or CMS of choice.

This is a tool for web developers or site administrators who frequently update publication listings for resident doctors, researchers, professors, etc.

CiteClinic interfaces with the [Crossref API](https://api.crossref.org/swagger-ui/index.html). Because of CiteClinic's focus on the medical community, it produces citations in [Vancouver Style](https://library.viu.ca/citing/vancouver). This may change if there is specific user demand for other citation formats.

## User Flow

- Type or paste a valid DOI string into the input bar, then click the "CITE" button.
- A citation is generated and housed under its own tab on the page. Tabs can be navigated between and deleted.
- Edit the text fields to see live changes to your citation.
- Modify border thickness, border color, and box shadow styles.
- Copy the HTML and CSS of your styled citation, which are regenerated with each change.
- Copy just the raw text, if desired.
- You can have a maximum of 8 active citations on the page.
