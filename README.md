# CiteClinic ![scroll](./static/favicon-32x32.png)

_CiteClinic_ is an in-development web application that allows users to easily **scrape citation information** from medical-focused research journal sites and **generate modifiable, styled UI citation components** for use on their sites.

👩‍💻 **Intended Userbase:** Web developers/web content managers for research institutions or universities that frequently update publications for resident doctors or researchers.

❗**Citation Format:** Because several of the supported journal sites are medical-focused, the citation format generated is in [Vancouver Style](https://library.viu.ca/citing/vancouver). This may change if there is specific user demand for other citation formats.

📖 **Currently supported journal sites include:**

1. New England Journal of Medicine
2. PubMed
3. Nature
4. The Lancet
5. JAMA Network
6. British Medical Journal

## Notable Features

- Scraped citation data is editable and the preview of users' components will update as they are modified.
- Component cosmetics (primarily colors and shadows) will be modifiable.
- Users can scrape one URL at a time or provide a .csv file of multiple URLs to be scraped from asynchronously.
- Pure citation text can be used if no styled component is desired.
- A sleek and intuitive user interface.
